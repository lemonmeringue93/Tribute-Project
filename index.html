    <h2>Importance of fruits</h2>
      <div id="tribute-info">
    <p>Eating fruit provides health benefits. People who eat more fruits and vegetables as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases, such as heart disease, including heart attack and stroke and certain types of cancers. Eating foods such as fruits that are lower in calories instead of higher-calorie food may be useful in helping to lower calorie intake. Fruits provide nutrients vital for health and maintenance of your body, such as fiber, vitamin C, potassium, and folate. For a list of the health benefits associated with fruit, see <a href src="https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/fruits" alt="link to more info" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">All About the Fruit Group.</a>

    <h2>Benefits to the planet</h2>
    <p>A major new study confirms that a diet high in fruit and vegetables is better for the planet than one high in animal products. The study also finds that organic food provides significant, additional climate benefits for plant-based diets, but not for diets with only moderate contribution from plant products. Published today in open access journal Frontiers in Nutrition, this is the first study to investigate the environmental impacts of both dietary patterns and farm production systems. It is also the first to investigate the environmental impact of organic food consumption using observed diets rather than models.
